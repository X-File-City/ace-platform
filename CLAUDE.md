# ACE Platform

A hosted "Playbooks as a Service" platform built on the ACE (Autonomous Capability Enhancement) three-agent architecture.

## Claude Code Instructions

**Virtual Environment:** Always activate the venv before running Python, pip, pytest, alembic, or any Python-based commands:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate && <command>
```

**Package Installation:** Always install packages into the venv, never globally:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate && pip install <package>
```

## Architecture Overview

- **ace_core/**: Core ACE implementation (Generator, Reflector, Curator agents)
- **ace_platform/**: Hosted platform layer (FastAPI API, MCP server, Celery workers)
- **web/**: Dashboard frontend
- **playbooks/**: Starter playbook templates
- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**: Detailed project architecture mermaid diagram

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Podman & Podman Compose for local development (Docker in production)
- OpenAI API key

### Quick Start (Hybrid - Recommended)

Run infrastructure in containers, application locally for hot-reload:

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the project
cd ace-platform

# 2. Start infrastructure services (use podman locally, docker in production)
podman compose up -d postgres redis

# 3. Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 5. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and database URLs

# 6. Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# 7. Start the development servers (in separate terminals)
uvicorn ace_platform.api.main:app --reload          # API server (port 8000)
python -m ace_platform.mcp.server                    # MCP server
celery -A ace_platform.workers.celery_app worker -l info  # Background worker
```

### Quick Start (Full Docker Stack)

Run everything in containers:

```bash
# 1. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (especially OPENAI_API_KEY)

# 2. Start complete stack (uses --profile full)
podman compose --profile full up -d

# This starts: postgres, redis, migrate, api, mcp, worker, beat

# 3. View logs
podman compose logs -f api       # API server logs
podman compose logs -f worker    # Worker logs

# 4. Stop everything
podman compose --profile full down
```

For minimal infrastructure only (postgres + redis):
```bash
podman compose up -d postgres redis
```

### Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/ace_platform
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### Running ACE Core Standalone

The `ace_core/` module can run independently for testing:

```bash
cd ace_core
source venv/bin/activate
python -m finance.run --task_name finer --mode offline --save_path results
```

### Testing

All new code written should have accompanying unit and integration tests.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test suites
pytest tests/test_api/ -v      # API tests
pytest tests/test_mcp/ -v      # MCP server tests
pytest tests/test_evolution/ -v # Evolution logic tests

# With coverage
pytest --cov=ace_platform tests/
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Linting
ruff check .

# Format
ruff format .
```

# Project Management

This project uses the beads CLI 'bd' for issue and project tracking.

1. File/update issues for remaining work

Agents should proactively create issues for discovered bugs, TODOs, and follow-up tasks
Close completed issues and update status for in-progress work
2. Run quality gates (if applicable)

Tests, linters, builds - only if code changes were made
File P0 issues if builds are broken
3. Sync the issue tracker carefully

Work methodically to ensure local and remote issues merge safely
Handle git conflicts thoughtfully (sometimes accepting remote and re-importing)
Goal: clean reconciliation where no issues are lost
4. Verify clean state

All changes committed and pushed
No untracked files remain
5. Choose next work

Provide a formatted prompt for the next session with context.

## Git Workflow

**Always use feature branches and pull requests:**
- Never commit directly to `main`
- Create a feature branch for all changes: `git checkout -b feature/description` or `git checkout -b fix/description`
- Push the feature branch and open a PR for review before merging to main
- PRs should include a summary of changes and test plan

## Context management

You are a LLM and therefore don't always have up to date knowledge in your internal knowledge. Due to this, always gather context about specific libraries, frameworks, technologies or coding patterns before generating files or writing code. This allows your output to be much more accurate and higher quality. Use the context7 MCP to do this when possible and use web search when context7 doesn't have the info you need.
