## What ACE Does

ACE is the open-source platform for self-improving AI agents.

Instead of treating prompts like disposable text, ACE treats instructions as living playbooks:

- Create structured playbooks for coding, research, writing, analysis, and operations
- Connect those playbooks to MCP-compatible tools like Claude Code, Codex, and custom clients
- Record outcomes from real work so useful patterns are not lost
- Automatically evolve playbooks into better versions over time

The result is simple: less prompt drift, fewer repeated mistakes, and better first-pass output.

## Why People Use ACE

- **Capture wins permanently**: turn a good run into reusable guidance instead of hoping the next session goes the same way
- **Learn from failure**: record misses, edge cases, and postmortems directly into the system that guides future work
- **Improve with real usage**: evolve playbooks from actual execution history rather than abstract best-practice docs
- **Stay tool-agnostic**: use ACE anywhere MCP fits into your workflow

ACE is also available as a hosted agent at [aceagent.io](https://aceagent.io), with the dashboard at [app.aceagent.io](https://app.aceagent.io) and documentation at [docs.aceagent.io](https://docs.aceagent.io).

## Hosted Quick Start

If you want to use ACE right away, the fastest path is the hosted service:

1. Create an account at [app.aceagent.io](https://app.aceagent.io).
2. Generate an API key with the scopes you need.
3. Connect ACE to your agent over MCP.

Example for Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http ace https://aceagent.io/mcp \
  --header "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Legacy SSE compatibility remains available at `https://aceagent.io/mcp/sse` through **May 22, 2026**.

- [Claude Code setup](https://docs.aceagent.io/docs/developer-guides/mcp-integration/claude-code/)
- [MCP integration guide](docs/MCP_INTEGRATION.md)

## Self-Hosting

You can run ACE on your own infrastructure with Docker Compose or a hybrid local-dev setup.

### Fastest Full-Stack Docker Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DannyMac180/ace-platform.git
cd ace-platform
cp .env.example .env

# Set at minimum:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=...
# JWT_SECRET_KEY=...

docker compose --profile full up -d
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

That starts PostgreSQL, Redis, migrations, the FastAPI API, the MCP server, Celery workers, and the scheduler.

### Local Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DannyMac180/ace-platform.git
cd ace-platform

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d postgres redis
alembic upgrade head

uvicorn ace_platform.api.main:app --reload
python -m ace_platform.mcp.server
celery -A ace_platform.workers.celery_app worker -l info
```

For the frontend:

```bash
lsof -ti :3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
cd web
npm ci
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

- [Environment variable reference](docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md)
- [Architecture overview](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Required Environment Variables

These are the minimum settings most self-hosted installations need:

| Variable | Required | What it is for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string for workers and sync operations |
| `REDIS_URL` | Yes | Redis connection for Celery and rate limiting |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes | Model access for playbook evolution and related LLM features |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Yes | Signing key for authentication tokens |
| `DATABASE_URL_ASYNC` | No | Async DB URL for API/MCP; auto-derived if omitted |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Recommended | Allowed browser origins for your frontend |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Recommended | Public frontend URL for redirects and app links |
| `OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL` | Recommended | Base URL for OAuth callback handling |
| `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` | Recommended | Separate secret for OAuth/session cookies |

Common optional integrations:

| Variable | When you need it |
| --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google login |
| `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub login |
| `BILLING_ENABLED`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe billing |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Error monitoring |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Transactional email |

Start from [.env.example](.env.example) for the full list.

## How ACE Is Organized

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ace_core/` | Core ACE logic and adaptation primitives |
| `ace_platform/` | Hosted platform backend, API, MCP server, workers, and DB layer |
| `web/` | React/Vite dashboard frontend |
| `docs-site/` | Documentation website source |
| `playbooks/` | Starter playbook templates |
| `tests/` | Backend and platform test suite |

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you want to improve ACE, the best path is a focused PR with a clear test plan.

1. Create a feature branch instead of working on `main`.
2. Add tests for new behavior.
3. Run the local quality gates before opening a PR:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate && ruff check ace_platform/ tests/
source venv/bin/activate && ruff format ace_platform/ tests/
source venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/ -v
```

If you touch the frontend, also run:

```bash
cd web
npm ci
npm run lint
npx vitest run
```

For larger changes, start with a small draft PR so we can align early.
