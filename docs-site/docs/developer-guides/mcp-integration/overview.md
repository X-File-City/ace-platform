# MCP Integration Overview

Connect your AI agents to ACE using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources. ACE provides an MCP server that exposes playbooks and evolution features as tools.

Benefits of MCP integration:
- **No code required** - Configure and use immediately
- **Bidirectional** - Read playbooks and record outcomes
- **Real-time** - Changes reflect immediately
- **Secure** - API key authentication

## MCP Server Endpoint

```
https://aceagent.io/mcp/sse
```

## Available Tools

ACE's MCP server exposes these tools:

## Authentication

MCP requires API key authentication via the `X-API-Key` header:

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

### Required Scopes

| Tool | Required Scope |
|------|----------------|
| `list_playbooks` | `playbooks:read` |
| `find_playbook` | `playbooks:read` |
| `get_playbook` | `playbooks:read` |
| `create_playbook` | `playbooks:write` |
| `create_version` | `playbooks:write` |
| `record_outcome` | `outcomes:write` (+ email verification) |
| `trigger_evolution` | `evolution:write` (+ email verification) |
| `get_evolution_status` | `evolution:read` |

## Connection

Connect via SSE (Server-Sent Events):

```
https://aceagent.io/mcp/sse
```

Use the native SSE configuration in your MCP client.

## Configuring Agent Instructions

After connecting the MCP server, you need to tell your agent *when* and *how* to use your playbooks. Add instructions to your agent's custom instructions file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, system prompt, or equivalent).

### Recommended Instructions Template

```markdown
## ACE Playbooks

This project uses ACE for self-improving AI instructions.
The ACE MCP server is configured and available.

### Workflow

For each new task (or when task intent changes materially):

1. **Discover relevant playbooks first (semantic search)**
   - Summarize the request as a concise task description
   - Prefer `find_playbook(task_description="<task description>")` to get the best match
   - If needed, use `list_playbooks(task="<task description>")` to review ranked alternatives
   - If no relevant playbook is found, continue normally and do not force playbook usage

2. **Load playbook instructions before doing the task (Generator step)**
   - Use `get_playbook(playbook_id="<selected id>")` for the selected playbook
   - Read the playbook content before starting execution
   - Apply those instructions during planning and implementation

3. **Execute the task using the playbook guidance**
   - Use one **primary** playbook for execution and outcome attribution
   - If multiple playbooks are relevant, keep additional playbooks as supporting context only

4. **Record outcomes automatically after task completion**
   - Call `record_outcome` exactly once per completed, playbook-guided task
   - Include all relevant fields:
     - `playbook_id`: ID of the primary playbook used
     - `task_description`: What was attempted, including scope and deliverable summary
     - `outcome`: `success`, `partial`, or `failure`
     - `notes`: What worked, what failed, key decisions, and blockers
     - `reasoning_trace`: Concise summary of reasoning and tradeoffs
   - If recording fails (permissions, validation, rate limit), report the error and continue helping the user

5. **Check for evolution when applicable**
   - If you manually call `trigger_evolution` and receive a Job ID, call `get_evolution_status(job_id=...)`
   - Do not call `get_evolution_status` without a known Job ID
```

### Where to Add Instructions

| Agent Type | Location |
|------------|----------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` in project root |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` in project root |
| Claude Desktop | Project instructions or conversation |
| Custom agents | System prompt or configuration file |
| LangChain/LlamaIndex | Agent system message |

### Tips for Effective Instructions

1. **Run discovery per task, not per message** - Reduces unnecessary calls while preserving relevance
2. **Load playbook content before execution** - Retrieval without applying content does not improve outcomes
3. **Use one primary playbook per task** - This keeps outcome attribution and evolution data clean
4. **Capture rich outcome details** - Better `notes` and `reasoning_trace` improve future evolution quality
5. **Keep it concise and explicit** - Short, direct instructions are more reliably followed

### Dynamic Playbook Discovery

The **Recommended Instructions Template** above already includes dynamic, semantic playbook discovery and follow-up workflow steps. Use that template as the single source of truth to avoid duplicated or drifting instructions.

## Usage Patterns

### Using a Playbook

```
1. Find best playbook match for the task
2. Get playbook content for the selected ID
3. Execute task with one primary playbook
4. Record one outcome after completion
```

### Evolution Workflow

```
1. Use playbooks and record outcomes
2. After enough outcomes, trigger evolution (or wait for auto-evolution every 5 outcomes)
3. Check evolution status only when you have a job ID
4. Get new version when complete
```

## Error Handling

MCP tools return plain-text responses. Most failures begin with `Error:` (plus a few actionable non-`Error:` messages).

Common error message patterns:

| Pattern | Meaning | Typical Action |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `Error: No API key provided...` | Missing API key | Set `X-API-Key`, `Authorization: Bearer`, tool `api_key`, or `ACE_API_KEY` |
| `Error: Invalid or revoked API key` | Bad or revoked key | Regenerate key and retry |
| `Error: API key lacks '<scope>' scope` | Key missing required permission | Create/use a key with the needed scope |
| `Error: ... not found` | Resource missing or inaccessible | Verify IDs and ownership |
| `Error: Access denied - ... belongs to another user` | Resource exists but belongs to someone else | Use resources owned by the authenticated user |
| `Error: Invalid ... format` / `Error: Invalid outcome status ...` | Invalid input values | Fix parameter format/value and retry |
| `Error: ... is required ...` / `Error: ... exceeds maximum size ...` | Validation failure | Provide required fields and keep payloads within limits |
| `Error: Rate limit exceeded ...` | Throttle reached | Wait and retry after the window resets |
| `Error: Email verification required ...` | User email not verified | Verify email, then retry |
| `Error: Start your free trial or subscribe to continue.` (and related subscription errors) | Account/subscription state blocks tool use | Start trial, subscribe, or fix billing status |
| `Evolution blocked: A payment method is required ...` | Manual evolution blocked by payment method requirement | Add a card, then trigger evolution again |
| `No playbooks found. Create one in the dashboard first.` | Valid call but user has no playbooks yet | Create a playbook before discovery/retrieval |

## Best Practices

1. **Discover playbooks semantically per task** - Use `find_playbook` (or `list_playbooks(task=...)`) when task intent changes
2. **Load instructions before execution** - Fetch the selected playbook with `get_playbook` before planning and implementation
3. **Use one primary playbook per task** - Keep outcome attribution clean and evolution signals high quality
4. **Record one rich outcome per completed task** - Include `task_description`, `outcome`, `notes`, and `reasoning_trace`
5. **Cache with refresh triggers** - Reuse playbook content, but refresh when task intent or target version changes
6. **Retry selectively** - Retry transient/rate-limit failures; fix-and-retry auth, scope, validation, and subscription errors
7. **Adopt new versions deliberately** - Pin versions for stable workflows and review evolved versions before relying on them

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Refused

- Check the MCP server URL
- Verify network connectivity
- Ensure API key is valid

### Authentication Failed

- Verify `ACE_API_KEY` env var or `X-API-Key` header is set correctly
- Check API key has required scopes
- Ensure key isn't revoked

### Tool Not Found

- Refresh MCP client connection
- Check server version compatibility
- Verify API key scopes include tool access
